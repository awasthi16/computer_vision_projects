1. What is an Image? 

A digital image is a 2D matrix of numbers representing intensity or color information.

1.1 Mathematical Definition

An image is a function:

𝑓
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
=
intensity at pixel position 
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
f(x,y)=intensity at pixel position (x,y)

x → horizontal coordinate

y → vertical coordinate

f(x, y) → pixel value

1.2 Types of Images
1) Grayscale Image

Contains only intensity (brightness) information

One channel

Pixel value range:

0 → black

255 → white

Represented as a matrix:

I
(
𝑚
×
𝑛
)
I(m×n)
2) RGB Image

3 channels → Red, Green, Blue

Pixel represented as:

(
𝑅
,
𝐺
,
𝐵
)
(R,G,B)

Each channel is an m×n matrix

Shape in NumPy: (height, width, 3)

3) RGBA Image

Adds alpha channel (transparency)

Channels = 4 → (R, G, B, A)

4) Binary Image

Pixel values: 0 or 1

Used in segmentation, thresholding.

🔹 2. Pixels & Intensity Values (Detailed)
2.1 Pixel

A pixel (picture element) is the smallest unit of a digital image.

Pixel Depth / Bit Depth

Defines how many intensity levels a pixel can store.

Bit Depth	Levels	Range
1-bit	2	0–1
8-bit	256	0–255
16-bit	65,536	0–65535
24-bit RGB	16.7M	(3 × 8-bit)

Higher bit depth → smoother color transitions.

2.2 Intensity

Intensity = brightness.

Grayscale → single intensity

Color → 3 intensity values (R,G,B)

Linear vs Nonlinear Intensity

Displays use gamma correction

Human eye is nonlinear → more sensitive to dark changes than bright

🔹 3. Image Histogram (In Depth)

An image histogram shows how many pixels exist at each intensity value.

3.1 Histogram for Grayscale

X-axis → intensity (0–255)

Y-axis → pixel count

What histograms tell you

Dark image → peaks near 0

Bright image → peaks near 255

High contrast → values spread out

Low contrast → values clustered

3.2 Histogram for Color Images

Separate histograms:

Red channel histogram

Green channel histogram

Blue channel histogram

Useful in:

Contrast enhancement

Thresholding

Segmentation

Equalization

🔹 4. Resolution & Aspect Ratio (Very Detailed)
4.1 Resolution

Resolution = total number of pixels:

Resolution
=
width
×
height
Resolution=width×height

Examples:

640×480 → VGA

1280×720 → HD

1920×1080 → Full HD

3840×2160 → 4K

Spatial Resolution

How much detail an image holds.

Higher resolution → more detail

Lower resolution → pixelation

4.2 Aspect Ratio
Aspect Ratio
=
𝑤
𝑖
𝑑
𝑡
ℎ
ℎ
𝑒
𝑖
𝑔
ℎ
𝑡
Aspect Ratio=
height
width
	​

Common Ratios:

4:3 → old TVs

16:9 → modern displays

1:1 → Instagram photos

Why aspect ratio matters:

Correct resizing

Avoid distortion

Video formats

🔹 5. Sampling & Quantization (Very Detailed)

These are two steps in converting a continuous image → digital image.

5.1 Sampling

Sampling = selecting pixel positions.

Increasing sampling → high resolution

Decreasing sampling → blocky, pixelated image

Nyquist Sampling Theorem

To avoid aliasing:

𝑓
𝑠
≥
2
𝑓
max
f
s
	​

≥2f
max
	​


Aliasing = distortions when sampling is too low.

Examples:

Moiré patterns

Jagged edges

5.2 Quantization

Quantization = converting continuous intensity → discrete levels.

Example:

8-bit image: 256 levels

2-bit image: only 4 levels

Higher quantization → smoother gradients
Lower → posterization (banding effect)

🔹 6. Color Spaces (Very Deep Explanation)

Color spaces are mathematical models that describe how colors are represented.

🟩 6.1 RGB Color Space

RGB = Red, Green, Blue

Additive color model

Used in screens, cameras

Values: 0–255 for each channel

Pros:

Simple

Standard for devices

Cons:

R, G, B channels are correlated

Sensitive to lighting

Not ideal for segmentation

🟦 6.2 HSV Color Space

HSV = Hue, Saturation, Value

Components:

Hue → color type

Saturation → purity of color

Value → brightness

Why HSV is important?

Color detection is easy

Lighting has less effect

Skin detection

Masking and segmentation

Example:
To detect yellow color → threshold on Hue only.

🟧 6.3 LAB Color Space

LAB = Lightness, a*, b*

Components:

L → lightness

a → green ↔ red

b → blue ↔ yellow

Why LAB is used?

Closest to human vision

Good for:

Color correction

White balancing

Histogram equalization

Used in Photoshop and industrial applications.

🟫 6.4 YCbCr Color Space

Used in:

JPEG compression

Videos

TV broadcasting

Components:

Y → luminance (brightness)

Cb → blue chroma

Cr → red chroma

Why use YCbCr?

Separating lightness and color improves compression

Human eyes are less sensitive to color than brightness
